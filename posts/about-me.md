My name is Guilherme Cirelli Lopes, an undergraduate student in Systems Analysis and Development at Unicesumar, passionate about web development. Known for dedication and integrity, I always strive to fulfill my commitments with excellence.

Combining study, hands-on practice, and mentorship, I quickly absorb new knowledge and deliver effective solutions. Understanding problems deeply before building solutions is something I highly value, along with clear communication and organized documentation to enhance teamwork.

Although still in the early stages of my career, I have developed solid skills in Next.js, JavaScript, and related technologies. Discipline, resilience, and continuous learning guide my growth. My goal is to keep evolving, leveraging my passion for software development to overcome challenges and create a positive impact in every project I undertake.
